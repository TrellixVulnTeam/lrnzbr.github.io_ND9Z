        <h1>VODKA WITH A GREAT TASTE AND A GREATER MISSION</h1>
        <p>Over the past few decades, the LGBTQIA community has gone from being a grassroots resistance movement to a mainstream cornerstone of American pop culture. One month out of the year, companies splash rainbow colors and join parades fighting for our attention and brand loyalty. But once July 1st comes around, it's business as usual. While it's great to celebrate progress made, we won't forget there's still a lot more work to do.</p>
        <p>Pride Vodka is dedicated to celebrating the pride all year around.  We honor the progress our community has made thus far while recognizing there's still a lot of work to do. At Pride Vodka, we strive to make great tasting vodka while giving thanks to the organizations that continue to uplift our community.   Each month, 10% of the profits from each bottle of Pride Vodka are donated to non-profit organizations supporting the LGBTQIA community and we lean on our customers to help us decide how these donations are distributed.  On every bottle of Pride Vodka is a QR code our customers can use to determine which organizations will receive their donated portion of their purchase.</p>
        <p>And although we hate to brag, this s$%t is pretty darn tasty. Try it for yourself and see. Our vodka is distilled here in Dallas, Texas. It's a smooth, simple, gluten-free corn-based vodka with a taste we know you'll love.</p>
